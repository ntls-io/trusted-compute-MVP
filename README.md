## ðŸ”¹ License Compliance & Automation

To ensure all files in the repository include the required license header, we provide a script to **automate license insertion**.

### **Adding License Headers Locally**
Run the following script to **automatically add the Nautilus AGPL license** to all supported files:

```bash
./add-license.sh
```

This will: âœ… Add license headers to all source code files (`.ts`, `.js`, `.py`, `.rs`, etc.)

* Add an HTML comment license block to .md files
* Skip unnecessary directories (node_modules, target, dist, etc.)

### GitHub License Check

We also enforce license compliance via GitHub Actions. On every PR, a CI check will fail if files are missing a license header.

To manually validate changed files before pushing, run:

```bash
git diff --name-only | xargs ./add-license.sh
```
