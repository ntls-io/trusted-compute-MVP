# SGX-MVP Directory

This directory contains all the relevant SGX code for NTC-MVP.

- `wasmi-impl` serves as the WebAssembly interpreter
- `python-impl` serves as the Python interpreter
- `test-data` contains sample JSON data and schemas
- `json-append` contains Rust code for the append functionality

# Quick Start

## Step 0

Follow the instructions in the [Gramine Installation Guide](https://gramine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html#install-gramine-packages-1) under "Install Gramine packages."

## Step 1

```sh
# Build the program and the final Gramine manifest
make SGX=1

# Run the program
make SGX=1 mvp
```

To test with non-SGX Gramine instead, omit `SGX=1` in both commands.

# Alternate Gramine use

```sh
# Run program with Gramine SGX
gramine-sgx sgx-mvp

# Run program without SGX
gramine-direct sgx-mvp
```

Note that _gramine-sgx_ requires all files we use in `sgx.trusted_files`

# Cleaning Up

To maintain a clean workspace, you can use the following commands:

## `make clean`

This command removes generated files and artifacts from the build process, including:
- All temporary tokens, signatures, and SGX manifests.
- The `result-*` files and any generated `OUTPUT` files.
- Cleans up the WASM binaries for _mean_, _median_, and _standard deviation_.

Run it as follows:

```sh
make clean
```

## `make distclean`

This command performs a more thorough cleanup by first invoking **make clean** and then removing additional files, such as:

- The target/ directory where compiled artifacts are stored.
- The Cargo.lock file, which can help ensure that the next build uses fresh dependencies.

Run it as follows:

```sh
make distclean
```
